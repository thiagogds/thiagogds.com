      <h1>Thiago Garcia</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm a Brazilian entrepreneur and software developer specialist in growing sustainable products through a well designed process.</p>
      <p>I'm very into <strong>business development</strong> and me and my partner <a href="http://israelst.com/">Israel</a> are transforming all these buzzwords I've just used into very cool things. Lets team up?</p>
      <p class="call-to-action"><a href="mailto:thiagogds14@gmail.com" class="btn" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Email', 'send');">Get in touch.</a></p>
      <p>Would you want to know me just a little more first? Go ahead. :)</p>

      <h2 id="xp">Some of my experiences</h2>

      <h3>Product developer at an Advertech</h3>
      <p>Gate builds products that support all teams inside an advertising agency by automating operational tasks and using data visualization techniques to give them the ability to create business opportunities to some of the most worldwide known brands.</p>

      <h3>Founder at Víbora brewery</h3>
      <p>Víbora is a brewery in Botafogo - Rio de Janeiro with a focus on branding and on the neighborhood. With this different business approach our profit margins are bigger. That way we can focus in making a better experience around beer without transforming our beer in a commodity.</p>


      <h2>Business beliefs</h2>
      <p>It is not just about software development, it is also about understand the numbers, the company's vision of the future, designing processes... The whole path.</p>

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>I work mainly with Python and Django, at the backend. I've chosen this path because of the Python community and I can use Python to create both a website and a complex Machine Learning stuff.</p>

      <h2>Principles</h2>
      <p>Talking about the principles. Yes, talking about it is one of them. :)</p>
      <p>We can start the conversation from the <a href="http://smallactsmanifesto.org/">Small Acts Manifesto</a> and the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python">The Zen of Python</a>. But I'm sure that we can spend hours talking about this.</p>
